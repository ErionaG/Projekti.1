              <h2>Upgrading to Ubuntu 24.10 Oracular Oriole: Step-by-Step Guide
                October 14, 2024</h2>
              <p><span id="span1">Canonical</span> released Ubuntu 24.10 “Oracular Oriole” on Oct. 10, 2024. This latest version brings performance improvements and enhanced hardware support while also marking a special milestone — 20 years since Ubuntu’s first stable release.<br><br>

                As the name suggests, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Long-Term Support) is still being supported and will continue to receive five years of free security maintenance updates.
                
                In this guide, you’ll learn how to upgrade your existing Ubuntu 24.04 installation to the latest Ubuntu 24.10.
                
                Why Upgrade to Ubuntu 24.10?
                As Ubuntu 24.04 is an LTS release, there’s no requirement to upgrade since it will be supported for at least five years. You can extend this for another five years through an Ubuntu Pro subscription, which is free for personal devices. Paid subscribers who install the Legacy Support add-on can benefit from an additional two years of coverage.
                
                Ubuntu 24.10 will receive security and maintenance for just nine months out of the box. However, it is also compatible with Ubuntu Pro and comes with several upgrades.
                
                For instance, Ubuntu now ships with the latest available version of the upstream Linux kernel. The kernel version is determined by Ubuntu’s freeze date, even if the kernel is still in Release Candidate (RC) status. This approach allows users to benefit from the latest features, though it may come at the possible expense of system stability.
                
                The main flavor of Ubuntu 24.10 also ships with the latest Gnome 47 desktop, an upgraded App Center, an experimental Security Center, and better management of Snap packages.
                
                See the official Oracular Oriole announcement to discover all the latest features in Ubuntu.
                
                How It Works
                Ubuntu 22.04 supports upgrading via the command line or the built-in software updater.
                
                The simplest way to upgrade is to launch the software updater to ensure you have the latest version of Ubuntu 22.04 (currently 22.04.01). Then, you can modify the updater settings to allow you to upgrade to a regular non-LTS release of Ubuntu.
                
                Rerunning the software updater will display the option to upgrade your OS.<br>
                Choose “Settings” to launch “Software & Updates.” From here, select the “Updates” tab. In the dropdown menu labeled “Notify me of a new Ubuntu version,” choose “For any new version.” This means Ubuntu 24.10 will appear as an upgrade option, even though it’s not a Long-Term Support release.

                Choose “Close,” then relaunch the Software Updater. You’ll now see a notification saying that Ubuntu 22.04 is up to date, but Ubuntu 24.10 is available. Choose “Upgrade” to continue.
                
                If this notification doesn’t appear, you can also manually check for the latest version of Ubuntu via Terminal. Open the utility and run:
                
                sudo update-manager -c
                
                Step 3. Start the Upgrade
                Once the Ubuntu upgrade utility launches, it will display a brief overview of everything new in Oracular Oriole. There’s also a link to the official release notes if you need a detailed breakdown.
                
                After reading through these, click “Start Upgrade” to continue. This will download the latest release upgrade tool.</p>
